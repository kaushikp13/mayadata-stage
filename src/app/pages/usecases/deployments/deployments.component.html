          <h2>Replication by OpenEBS</h2>
          <p>Stateful applications on Kubernetes deployed as “deployment” usually do not have the
            replication
            capabilities. It is expected that the
            underlying storage system will handle the necessary replication and provides high availability. In such
            cases,
            OpenEBS volumes will have
            three replicas.</p>

          <h2>OpenEBS vs LocalPV for statefulset</h2>
          <p>There are multiple advantages of deploying statefulset with OpenEBS PVs as OpenEBS is an
            integrated solution created to provide answers
            For applications deployed as a Kubernetes deployment, replication is done by storage software. OpenEBS is
            well
            suited for achieving this
            need. With OpenEBS, each volume will have a storage controller and up to three replicas, where the data is
            synchronously replicated by the
            controller to all the replicas.</p>
