      title: `Withstand cluster disasters`,
      description: `OpenEBS' ability to spread volumes across multiple nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, as well as automatic recovery of degraded replicas without operator involvement, was the highest requirement of Arista for a storage solution, and OpenEBS met this perfectly.`

    {
      title: `Kubernetes Rolling Upgrades`,
      description: `Another important use case is supporting the rolling upgrades of Kubernetes itself.  Rolling upgrades with Kubernetes are a breeze thanks to OpenEBS since the Arista team only needs to maintain quorum - for example 2 out of 3 nodes - and so can blow away a single node during the upgrade process.  These nodes typically would also be backed up using the Velero plug-in to OpenEBS.`

    {
      title: `Separate Application from storage`,
      description: `The application is now entirely decoupled from where the storage is thanks to the iSCSI backbone. Also, with the help of the NDM capabilities of NDM, the Arista team optimizes storage nodes vs. nodes serving applications and then serves storage as needed over iSCSI.`
    },
    {
      title: `Configure and deploy with ease`,
      description: `Additionally, the deployment of OpenEBS is effortless, made all the more so because OpenEBS doesnâ€™t require many nodes to operate, unlike traditional shared everything models such as CEPH.  The amount of nodes required to operate OpenEBS is incomparably lower and more efficient.  Ongoing operations and resilience is improved thanks in part to the use of proven technologies within OpenEBS such as iSCSI and ZFS. `
